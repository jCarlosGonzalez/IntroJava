 There isn't anything to compare.main and master are entirely different commit histories.

 Solution
  	The following operations will forcibly overwrite the original code, 
	so you need to save the content you want to keep in advance, 
	and then manually update it after overwriting.

		git checkout master
		git branch main master -f
		git checkout main
		git push origin main -f
